# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game

This project is the capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).
This project is based on the starter code from the udacity starter repo, a triditional snake game.

In this code, the snake game is modified with following functions:

(1) one food were regularly generated each second, until the food on the board reach the maximum food number(initial value is 30).
(2) When The head of snake crush with snake's body, part of the snake body will be cutted and turns to food.
   numbers of food generated by this "cutting" process is equal to half of the size of the cutted snake body.
   This rule also works for a snake bite himself, as in a traditional snake game biting yourself leads to termination of game.
(3) When head of two snakes crushed together, the snake with longer length of body will alive and the other snake dead.
   length of bigger snake will increse and the increase value is equal to half of the dead snake's length.
(4) instead of 1 snake in the ordinary game, there are 1 player snake and 4 AI snakes searching for food automatically by using A* search algorithm.
   snakes start with initial length of 4 grids.
(5) AI snakes will only search for food and will not "attack" other snakes on purpose in the present version. 
(6) game will end when there are only one snake alive in the board, or 3 minutes elapsed.
   The snake with longest length in the end will win the game.
